    <h4>Secure Shell & Secure Copy </h4>
    <p>
      <code>ssh</code> (secure shell) is an encrypted remote login tool. It lets you connect to remote resources, such as the OSG Connect login node and interact with the machine via UNIX shell.
      Similarly, <code>scp</code> (secure copy) is a tool that facilitates encrypted file transfer. We will use both to interact with OSG Connect.
